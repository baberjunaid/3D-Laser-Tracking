This project track the person in indoor environment using 3D LiDAR. <br> 

<b> Abstract</b> <br>

<p> Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology
is now becoming the main tool in many applications such as
autonomous driving and human robot collaboration. Point-cloud
based 3D object detection is getting popular and widely accepted
in industry and everyday life due to its effectiveness against
cameras in challenging environment. In this paper, we present
a modular approach to detect, track and classify persons using
a 3D LiDAR sensor. It combines multiple principles: a robust
implementation for object segmentation, a classifier with local
geometric descriptors and a tracking solution. Moreover, we
achieve a real time solution in a low-performance machine by
reducing the amount of points to be processed by obtaining and
predicting regions of interest via movement detection and motion
prediction without any previous knowledge of the environment.
Furthermore, our prototype is able to successfully detect and
track persons consistently even in challenging cases due to
limitations on the sensor field of view or extreme pose changes
such as crouching, jumping, and stretching. Lastly, the proposed
solution is tested and evaluated in multiple real 3D LiDAR sensor
recordings taken in indoor environment. The results show great
potential, particularly a high confidence in positive classifications
of human body as compared to state-of-the art approaches. <p>
